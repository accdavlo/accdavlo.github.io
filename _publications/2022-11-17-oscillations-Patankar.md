Modified Patankar (MP) schemes are conservative, linear implicit and unconditionally positivity preserving time-integration schemes constructed for production-destruction systems. 
For such schemes, a classical stability analysis does not yield any information about the performance. Recently, two different techniques have been proposed to investigate the properties of MP schemes. In Izgin et al. ESAIM: M2AN, 56 (2022), inspired from dynamical systems, the Lyapunov stability properties of such schemes have been investigated, while in [Torlo et al. Appl. Numer. Math., 182 (2022)](/publication/2021-08-18-stability-patankar) their oscillatory behaviour has been studied. In this work, we investigate the connection between the oscillatory behaviour and the Lyapunov stability and we prove that a condition on the Lyapunov stability function is necessary to avoid oscillations. We verify our theoretical result on several numerical tests.
