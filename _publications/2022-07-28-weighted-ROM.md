title: "Weighted Reduced Order Methods for Uncertainty Quantification"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-07-28-weighted-ROM
excerpt: 'Partial differential equations (PDEs) are an effective tool to model phenomena in applied sciences. Realistic problems usually depend on several physical and geometrical parameters that can be calibrated by using real data. In real scenarios, however, these parameters are affected by uncertainty due to measurement errors or scattered data information. To deal with more reliable models which take this issue into account, stochastic PDEs can be numerically approximated. In the uncertainty quantification (UQ) context, many simulations are run to better understand the system at hand and to compute statistics of outcomes over quantities of interest. In particular, the input parameters of the stochastic PDEs are assumed to be random finite-dimensional variables.'
