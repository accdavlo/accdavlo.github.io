Classical Finite Volume methods for multi-dimensional problems include stabilization (e.g. via a Riemann solver), that is derived by considering several one-dimensional problems in different directions. Such methods therefore ignore a possibly existing balance of contributions coming from different directions, such as the one characterizing multi-dimensional stationary states. Instead being preserved, they are usually diffused away by such methods. Stationarity preserving methods use a better suited stabilization term that vanishes at the stationary state, allowing the method to preserve it. This work presents a general approach to stationarity preserving Finite Volume methods for nonlinear conservation/balance laws. It is based on a multi-dimensional extension of the global flux approach. The new methods are shown to significantly outperform existing ones even if the latter are of higher order of accuracy and even on non-stationary solutions.
