excerpt: "Friedrichs' systems unify various elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic semi-linear PDEs. We use a discontinuous Galerkin discretization to approximate such equations and we apply classical model order reduction techniques for parameterized problems. To tackle the slow Kolmogorov n-width that they show, we adopt two techniques. First, we use a domain decomposition based on different indicators, that allow to reduce the number of basis on smooth areas. Secondly, inspired by the concept of vanishing viscosity, we adopt a Graph Neural Network that forecasts the solution given some high viscosity solutions for the same parameter obtained with the presented reduction techniques, recalling that for high viscosity we do not observe slow Kolmogorov n-width."

Friedrichs' systems (FS) are symmetric positive linear systems of first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), which provide a unified framework for describing various elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic semi-linear PDEs such as the linearized Euler equations of gas dynamics, the equations of compressible linear elasticity and the Dirac-Klein-Gordon system. FS were studied to approximate PDEs of mixed elliptic and hyperbolic type in the same domain. For this and other reasons, the versatility of the discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) represents the best approximation space for FS. We implement a distributed memory solver for stationary FS in deal.II. Our focus is model order reduction. Since FS model hyperbolic PDEs, they often suffer from a slow Kolmogorov n-width decay. We develop two approaches to tackle this problem. The first is domain decomposable reduced-order models (DD-ROMs). We will show that the DGM offers a natural formulation of DD-ROMs, in particular regarding interface penalties, compared to the continuous finite element method. We also develop new repartitioning strategies to obtain more efficient local approximations of the solution manifold. The second approach involves graph neural networks used to infer the limit of a succession of projection-based linear ROMs corresponding to lower viscosity constants: the heuristic behind is to develop a multi-fidelity super-resolution paradigm to mimic the mathematical convergence to vanishing viscosity solutions while exploiting to the most interpretable and certified projection-based ROMs.
