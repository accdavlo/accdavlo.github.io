title: "Calibration-Based ALE Model Order Reduction for Hyperbolic Problems with Self-Similar Travelling Discontinuities"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-03-18-ROM-calibration-2D
excerpt: 'We propose a novel Model Order Reduction framework that is able to handle solutions of hyperbolic problems characterized by multiple travelling discontinuities. By means of an optimization based approach, we introduce suitable calibration maps that allow us to transform the original solution manifold into a lower dimensional one. The optimization process does not require the knowledge of the discontinuities location. In the online phase, the coefficients of the projection of the reduced order solution onto the reduced space are recovered by means of an Artificial Neural Network. To validate the methodology, we present numerical results for the 1D Sod shock tube problem and for the 2D double Mach reflection problem, also in the parametric case.'

We propose a novel Model Order Reduction framework that is able to handle solutions of hyperbolic problems characterized by multiple travelling discontinuities. By means of an optimization based approach, we introduce suitable calibration maps that allow us to transform the original solution manifold into a lower dimensional one. The optimization process does not require the knowledge of the discontinuities location. In the online phase, the coefficients of the projection of the reduced order solution onto the reduced space are recovered by means of an Artificial Neural Network. To validate the methodology, we present numerical results for the 1D Sod shock tube problem, for the 2D double Mach reflection problem and a triple point shock interaction, also in the parametric case.
