title: "An optimisation-based domain-decomposition reduced order model for parameter-dependent non-stationary fluid dynamics problems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-08-04-optimization-domain-decomposition-unsteady
excerpt: 'In this work, we address parametric non-stationary fluid dynamics problems within a model order reduction setting based on domain decomposition. Starting from the domain decomposition approach, we derive an optimal control problem, for which we present the convergence analysis. The snapshots for the high-fidelity model are obtained with the Finite Element discretisation, and the model order reduction is then proposed both in terms of time and physical parameters, with a standard POD-Galerkin projection. We test the proposed methodology on two fluid dynamics benchmarks: the non-stationary backward-facing step and lid-driven cavity flow. Finally, also in view of future works, we compare the intrusive POD--Galerkin approach with a non--intrusive approach based on Neural Networks.'

In this work, we address parametric non-stationary fluid dynamics problems within a model order reduction setting based on domain decomposition. Starting from the domain decomposition approach, we derive an optimal control problem, for which we present the convergence analysis. The snapshots for the high-fidelity model are obtained with the Finite Element discretisation, and the model order reduction is then proposed both in terms of time and physical parameters, with a standard POD-Galerkin projection. We test the proposed methodology on two fluid dynamics benchmarks: the non-stationary backward-facing step and lid-driven cavity flow. Finally, also in view of future works, we compare the intrusive POD--Galerkin approach with a non--intrusive approach based on Neural Networks.
