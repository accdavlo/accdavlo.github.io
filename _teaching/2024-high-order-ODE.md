Goal
======
The course aims to make the student aware of the cutting-edge algorithms used to numerically perform time integration and their properties in order to optimally choose the proper time integrator according to the considered phyisical model.

Programme
======
 * Theory of ODEs: examples, classification, existence and uniqueness of solutions.
 * Simple methods: explicit and implicit Euler, convergence, stability analysis, properties.
 * High order classical methods.
   * Runge--Kutta methods: construction, explicit, implicit, IMEX, error and stability analysis, properties, the Butcher tableau.
   * Multistep methods: explicit, implicit methods, error and stability analysis, convergence.
 * Iterative explicit high order methods: Deferred Correction (DeC), Arbitrary Derivative (ADER) methods, properties, stability and convergence analysis.
 * Unconditionally positivity preserving schemes: implicit Euler, high order schemes, modified Patankar schemes and their stability and convergence analysis.
 * Entropy conservative high order schemes: relaxation Runge--Kutta methods.

Prerequisites
======
* Basics of numerical analysis
* More details on the installation for running the notebooks can be found on the repository [github.com/accdavlo/HighOrderODESolvers](https://github.com/accdavlo/HighOrderODESolvers#readme)
