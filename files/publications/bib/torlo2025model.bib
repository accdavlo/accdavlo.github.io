abstract="Classical model order reduction (MOR) techniques struggle in compressing solution manifolds when local structures travel along the domain. We study MOR algorithms for unsteady parametric advection dominated hyperbolic problems, giving a complete offline and online description, obtaining improved time saving in the online phase. We work in an arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian (ALE) framework in both offline and online phases. We calibrate the solutions aligning the advected features in a reference domain. Then, a classical MOR algorithm (PODEI--Greedy) is used in the ALE framework, while the calibration map is learned through regression techniques. We test the algorithm on scalar one-dimensional hyperbolic problems with various boundary conditions, showing that we outperform classical methods. Finally, we compare the results obtained with different calibration maps.",
