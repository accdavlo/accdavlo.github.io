Hello visitor! I am Davide Torlo, a postdoctoral researcher at [INRIA Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-bordeaux-sud-ouest) in [CARDAMOM](https://team.inria.fr/cardamom/) team, under the supervision of [prof. Mario Ricchiuto](https://team.inria.fr/cardamom/marioricchiuto/). I earned my PhD at [University of Zurich](https://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=home) under the supervision of [prof. RÃ©mi Abgrall](https://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=people&key1=8882). Before, I studied in [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/) and [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it) for my Master, where I did my thesis with [prof. Gianluigi Rozza](https://people.sissa.it/~grozza/), and at [University of Milan - Bicocca](https://unimib.it) for my Bachelor studies.


Current research
======
Currently I work at CARDAMOM team in INRIA - Bordeaux. I work on different Numerical Analysis projects.
1. Stabilized Finite Element methods. We are studying highly accurate space and time discretization for hyperbolic problems. We use different time integrators, space discretizations and stabilization techniques. The goal is to find the stability regions and the best perfomant scheme.
1. Reduced model for dispersive waves. The goal is to split dispersive waves equations into hyperbolic and elliptic part and to reduce the model for the elliptic part of the problem.
1. Arbitarily high order time integration schemes. I am often working with the Deferred Correction (DeC) time integration method or with ADER. I study their properties and their possible extentions to structure preserving schemes. Check out [ADER is DeC](/publication/2021-02-10-ADER-is-DeC) and [mPDeC](/publication/2020-07-01-mPDeC).

Previous Projects
=================
During my PhD and my Master I've studied high order accurate methods and model order reduction techniques for hyperbolic problems. The dissertation is available [here](http://accdavlo.github.io/files/theses/TorloPhDThesisOneSided.pdf).
1. I have studied an implicit--explicit discretization for kinetic models with arbitrary high order accuracy, through the Deferred Correction as time integration scheme and Residual distribution for the spatial discretization. [Publication on the topic](/publication/2020-06-29-high-order-IMEX-DeC)
1. MOR techniques for hyperbolic problems for advection dominated problems with an *ad hoc* arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian model to track the steep fronts, [here](/publication/2020-03-30-MOR-AD-ALE_1D), and for uncertainty quantification applications [here](/publication/2019-03-01-model-UQ).
1. Weighted MOR algorithm to speed up the computation in stochastic PDE. I wrote a [post](/posts/2021/02/wMOR/) on that and there is a [publication](/publication/2018-10-25-stabilized-weighted) about it.
