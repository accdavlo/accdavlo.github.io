Here I show the updated picture of all cases, deaths, hospitalized, ICU of Italy. All lines are shown in one plot with a rescaling factor.
The y-axis is in logarithmic scale. Data is taken from the [github repository of Protezione civile](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).

The script to obtain this plot I used [this script](/scripts/covid/testPlot.py) whose Colab version is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-OhY-J5-i9kklhlDXuyhO6duwjfrcq1v?usp=sharing).
